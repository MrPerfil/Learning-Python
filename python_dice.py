##In this project, we're doing a Dice! 
#Frist, we need to import something random. So,
import random
#Now, we need to create a variable and give it the random value.
dice=random.randint(1,6) 
#The 1,6 is the minimum and maximum.
#We already have a dice. Now we just need to print the variable if we wanna see the number.
print (dice)
#Now, if we run it, we'll get a random number between 1 and 6.
#I don't know why, but the frist 3 times I ran the code, I got 1.
